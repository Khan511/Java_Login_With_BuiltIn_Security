# Java_Login_backen_With_BuiltIn_Security
This project includes a complete, production-ready authentication system with the following features:

Username & Password Authentication: Secure login using encrypted user credentials.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access to APIs and features is restricted based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification step (e.g., email or token).

Email Confirmation: Users must verify their email address after creating account.

JWT Authentication:

Access Tokens for secure, stateless authentication.

Refresh Tokens to renew sessions without forcing frequent logins.

Login Attempt Limiting: Accounts are automatically blocked after 5 consecutive failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

Custom Error Handling: Centralized and consistent error responses for better debugging and user feedback.

Document Access Security: Documents are protected and access is restricted based on user roles and permissions to ensure only authorized users can view or modify them...
